### Enviroment Variables

__TODO: Use CMake or something similar__
 
The Visual Studio solution expects the following enviroment variables to configured.

`SDL2_INCLUDE` - SDL2 include folder path

`SDL2_LIB32` - SDL2 (32 bit) library folder path (`SDL2main.lib`, `SDL2.lib`, `SDL2.dll`)

`SDL2_LIB64` - Same as above but for the 64 bit libraries

`YAMLCPP_INCLUDE` - yaml-cpp include folder path

`YAMLCPP_LIB32` - yaml-cpp library folder path (`yaml-cpp.lib`, `yaml-cppd.lib`) 

`YAMLCPP_LIB64` - Same as above but for the 64 bit libraries
